# Usability Evaluation of FormWaypoint Web Application

## Assumptions

The click‑through testing could not be performed against a running instance because the browser environment blocks access to localhost and 127.0.0.1, and the repository is not available for cloning. Instead, the analysis is based on reading the updated React components in the apps/web folder. Where appropriate, behaviours have been inferred from the code and from the accompanying design cues. If any of these assumptions are incorrect, adjust the recommendations accordingly.

## Overview

FormWaypoint is a multifaceted shipping documentation platform with modules for importing data (CSV/OCR), reviewing documents, managing shipments, maintaining address and product libraries, generating shipping templates, viewing analytics, managing routing rules, screening against denied party lists, configuring settings/integrations, exporting to ERP systems, Kanban-style shipment tracking and a supply‑chain map. The application employs modern UI libraries (Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, Framer Motion and React Router) and adopts a consistent aesthetic across pages. The following table summarises the usability findings for each screen.

## Screen‑by‑Screen Findings

| Screen | What Works Well | What Needs Improvement | Suggested Improvements |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Login** (/login) | Clear branding and concise copy; animations provide a polished feel; fields have accessible labels and icons; error messages animate into view and auto‑dismiss; a sign‑up toggle allows account creation [\[1\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/auth/Login.jsx#L35-L62). | Missing “remember me” or password reset links; password requirements are not indicated; registration uses the same form which may confuse flows; the design does not mention password complexity or privacy policy. | Add a link to reset forgotten passwords; display password requirements inline (e.g., minimum length) before submission; separate sign‑in and sign‑up flows to reduce cognitive load; provide an option to stay signed in securely; include a link to terms/privacy. |
| **Dashboard** (/) | Upload zone clearly communicates accepted file types and supports drag‑and‑drop or click to upload; status indicators (“processing”, “uploading” and error states) are handled gracefully[\[2\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/upload/UploadZone.jsx#L71-L151); list of existing shipments appears below upload area; ERP link is conditionally displayed based on feature flags[\[3\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx#L14-L56). | Hard‑coded API endpoints use localhost:3001 and will not work in production; there is no visible indication of maximum file size; the upload area could be more prominent on large screens; shipments list design is not visible in the code, so details like sorting, pagination and actions are unclear. | Replace hard‑coded endpoints with environment variables; show sample CSV template and maximum file size; use responsive grid to ensure the upload zone doesn’t feel sparse on wide screens; ensure the shipments list supports search, filtering and pagination. |
| **Import Data** (/import) | Two clear import methods (CSV or OCR) with distinct icons and descriptive text; a status machine handles uploading, success and error states and displays contextual messaging[\[4\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/import/ImportPage.jsx#L55-L117); success panel offers actions to import another file or review the created shipment[\[5\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/import/ImportPage.jsx#L91-L117). | Hard‑coded endpoints (http://localhost:3001/import/csv and …/ocr) break in deployed environments; there is no feedback for large file uploads (e.g., progress bars); the interface does not tell users what happens to files after upload or where to find them if an error occurs. | Use environment variables for API URLs; implement progress bars for long uploads; display accepted file size limits and time estimates; after an error provide clear next steps (e.g., “Check file format or contact support”). |
| **Document Review** (/shipments/new, /documents/:id) | Provides a comprehensive editor for shipments and documents: editable address blocks, incoterm/currency fields, reference management, line items table, profitability card, carrier booking panels, AES and sanctions panels, comment threads and history[\[6\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/review/DocumentReview.jsx#L295-L353)[\[7\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/review/DocumentReview.jsx#L389-L600). Toolbars let users switch between edit and view modes and export documents to multiple formats. Validation issues are surfaced in an alert with dismissal options[\[8\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/review/DocumentReview.jsx#L357-L382). | Overly dense layout: forms, tables and panels all appear on one page causing cognitive overload; crucial actions like “Save” and “Generate PDF” share a toolbar with secondary actions such as “Discard”; no autosave or indicator that changes are unsaved; the complexity may confuse first‑time users; the ability to dismiss validation errors could lead to ignored compliance issues. | Break the page into tabs or accordions (e.g., “Header”, “Line Items”, “Compliance”, “History”); persist unsaved edits with autosave and show a subtle “saved” indicator; group primary actions (save/export) apart from destructive actions (discard) and confirm before discarding; provide explanations for validation errors and discourage indiscriminate dismissal (e.g., require a justification). |
| **Shipment Review** (/shipments/:id) | Builds on document review with a status bar indicating current shipment status and allows toggling between internal and client views; provides quick actions to advance shipment status (ready, booked, in transit) and to flag exceptions[\[9\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/review/ShipmentReviewPage.jsx#L56-L119). Offers a view mode toggle for external sharing with clear styling and a pulse indicator. | Uses confirm dialogs for status changes but lacks context about effects (e.g., “mark booked” triggers booking and label generation?); there is no timeline of status changes; “client view” hides pricing information but other sensitive fields might still be exposed; status change buttons are always visible even if the action is not allowed in the current status. | Include a progress timeline to show previous status changes and user actions; provide tooltips or inline descriptions explaining what each status change will trigger; dynamically disable or hide actions not relevant to the current status; ensure “client view” sanitises all sensitive information. |
| **Address Book** (/parties) | Clean card‑based layout with search and filtering; ability to add, edit and delete contacts; shows key information with icons (address, email, phone)[\[10\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/address-book/AddressBookPage.jsx#L67-L99); uses a modal for creation/edit which enforces required fields[\[11\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/address-book/PartyModal.jsx#L59-L100). | Search uses immediate API calls on each keystroke without debouncing; editing occurs in a modal which could be difficult on mobile devices; deletion uses a browser confirm dialogue which breaks the visual style; no bulk actions or export capability; there is no sorting or grouping. | Implement debounced search requests to reduce server calls; add responsive full‑screen modals on small screens; replace native confirm dialogs with styled confirmation modals; allow bulk operations (e.g., delete multiple contacts) and CSV export; enable sorting by name or country. |
| **Product Library** (/items) | Presents products in a sortable table with columns for SKU, description, HTS code, origin and value; allows adding, editing and deleting products via a modal; searching by SKU or description works similarly to the address book[\[12\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/items/ProductLibraryPage.jsx#L92-L135). | As with the address book, search lacks debouncing; no pagination or column sorting is implemented; there is no visual indicator when the list is empty aside from an icon and text; editing the “Origin (ISO)” field is confusing because the corresponding input is labelled “ECCN” in the code, which appears miswired[\[13\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/items/ProductModal.jsx#L94-L112). | Implement server‑side pagination and column sorting; debounce search; provide an “Import products” capability to bulk upload items; correct the “Origin” input to map to countryOfOrigin; show a message when no results are found after search. |
| **Template Library** (/templates) | Categorises shipment templates into recommended and other sections; template cards display summary info and visually differentiate recommended templates with badges and accent colours[\[14\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/templates/TemplateLibraryPage.jsx#L59-L69); search filters templates; uses a consistent card design. | The “New Template” button triggers an alert instructing users to create templates from shipments instead of providing a proper creation workflow[\[15\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/templates/TemplateLibraryPage.jsx#L34-L35); deletion is not implemented; recommended logic is based on name matching (“standard” or “express”), which could mislabel templates; there is no preview of templates. | Provide a dedicated “Create template” flow (e.g., selecting a shipment and saving as template) and remove the alert; implement deletion via API; base recommendations on usage statistics rather than name heuristics; add a preview modal showing the template’s line items and fields. |
| **Reports & Analytics** (/reports) | Offers a date‑range selector and refresh button; summary cards display total shipments, document types, active issues and overrides with trend indicators; includes carrier scorecards, tables for top destinations, common issues and overrides; allows exporting overrides to CSV[\[16\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportsPage.jsx#L110-L140)[\[17\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportsPage.jsx#L151-L196). | Heavy reliance on tables makes it hard to digest trends visually; no charts or graphs for time‑based data; no filtering by shipment type or carrier; error handling is limited to console logging; performance might suffer with large datasets. | Introduce interactive charts (line/bar) to visualise shipment volume, issues and overrides over time; allow users to filter by carrier, country or status; include tooltips and definitions for metrics; implement skeleton loaders while data loads; centralise error handling to show user‑friendly messages. |
| **Routing Rules Engine** (/rules) | Provides a drag‑and‑drop–style list of conditional rules, each with fields for IF condition and THEN action; supports enabling/disabling rules, editing names, priorities and conditions; includes an “Add New Rule” button and a save action with success or error feedback[\[18\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/rules/RoutingRulesPage.jsx#L117-L219). | Uses mock data when the API is unavailable, which may confuse users; rule reordering via drag handles is indicated but not implemented; there is no validation (e.g., ensuring conditions are meaningful or actions exist); the UI does not prevent conflicting rules; large sets of rules may be hard to scan. | Replace mock API with real endpoints and show a clear message when the feature is not available; implement drag‑and‑drop to reorder rules; add validation to ensure each rule has a valid condition and action; allow grouping or collapsing rules; provide templates or suggestions for common rules. |
| **Compliance Screening** (/compliance) | Clear form for manual denied‑party screening with required fields; results panel displays either a success (clean) or a denied status with a list of hits and recommended actions[\[19\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/compliance/ComplianceScreeningPage.jsx#L110-L151); includes loading and error states. | The service is asynchronous and may take time but the UI only shows a spinner; search criteria are limited (no ID or partial names); there is no ability to save or export screening results; error messages are generic; the form is not keyboard‑optimised (e.g., pressing Enter in the first input submits prematurely). | Provide progress feedback (e.g., percentage or message such as “Querying OFAC lists…”); allow advanced search parameters like identification numbers; add an option to export or save screening results; improve error messages with possible causes; trap focus within the form and results panel for better keyboard accessibility. |
| **Settings: Feature Flags** (/settings) | Simple list shows the current state of each feature flag using badges coloured green/red[\[20\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsPage.jsx#L18-L41); explains that flags are controlled by backend variables. | Users cannot toggle or request changes to feature flags; the page lacks grouping or descriptions of what each flag controls; there is no audit or history of changes. | Add the ability for authorised users to enable/disable flags within permissible scope; group flags by domain (e.g., “Carrier Integrations”, “Compliance”); provide tooltips describing each flag’s purpose; record changes with user and timestamp information. |
| **Settings: Integrations** (/settings/integrations) | Presents ERP integration settings with clear adapter selection (JDE vs SAP) using radio cards; forms adapt to the selected adapter; success/error messages appear after saving[\[21\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/settings/IntegrationsPage.jsx#L35-L47)[\[22\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/settings/IntegrationsPage.jsx#L52-L75). | Does not provide test connection functionality; password fields are not obscured when prefilled; the active adapter label might not be obvious to screen readers; there is no documentation link explaining required parameters; the layout might be cramped on small screens. | Add a “Test Connection” button that validates credentials before saving; mask passwords and provide an eye‑icon toggle to reveal/hide input; use ARIA attributes on radio cards; include inline help describing each field; stack form fields vertically on small screens. |
| **ERP Export Dashboard** (/erp) | Includes system‑health indicator with colour and pulse animations; lists ERP configurations and job history with statuses; allows running manual exports via a modal with date selection; provides retry and log download actions; health summarises recent failures[\[23\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/erp/ErpExportDashboard.jsx#L108-L138)[\[24\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/erp/ErpExportDashboard.jsx#L142-L175). | Lacks filtering/sorting of job history; the “download log” action is stubbed with an alert; date range defaults to the same day, forcing manual edits; configuration cards show a settings icon but no editing functionality; the health indicator may not account for warning thresholds beyond failed jobs. | Implement sorting and filtering on job history (by date, status or configuration); integrate real download links; prefill the “from” date to a recent default (e.g., last week); link the settings icon to the integration settings page; extend health indicator to include metrics such as job latency or queue length. |
| **Kanban Board** (/kanban) | Visualises shipment statuses across columns with drag‑and‑drop; counts shipments per status; clicking a card navigates to the shipment review page; colour‑coded borders indicate status[\[25\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.jsx#L147-L179). | Hard‑coded API endpoints (http://localhost:3000/shipments) cause failures in production; there is no offline handling or error UI; reordering within a column does not persist order; only a subset of statuses are supported; there is no search or filter. | Use environment variables for API URLs; display skeleton or error messages when shipments fail to load; persist ordering on the server; support more statuses (e.g., “Cancelled”) and allow custom statuses; add a search/filter bar to quickly find shipments. |
| **Supply Chain Map** (/map) | Uses Leaflet to plot shippers and consignees on a map with coloured route lines and a legend; markers show tooltips with name, location and a link back to the shipment[\[26\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/map/SupplyChainMap.jsx#L65-L110). Shipments are filtered to those with coordinates and sorted by status priority[\[27\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/components/map/SupplyChainMap.jsx#L21-L40). | External resources for marker icons are loaded from CDN (which may break offline); there is no clustering for overlapping markers; performance may degrade with large numbers of shipments; the default view is North America with no ability to pan/zoom preserved across sessions; route lines are dashed only for certain statuses, which may not be obvious. | Bundle marker images locally or through the app’s assets; implement marker clustering to handle many shipments; remember the last map centre and zoom in local storage; allow filters for shipment status and date; use consistent line styles with an explicit legend (e.g., dashed \= planned). |
| **Login/Protected Routing** (app‑level) | Implements a ProtectedRoute wrapper to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page; tokens are stored in localStorage and set on the API client; on login the user is redirected back to their original page[\[28\]](https://github.com/JoelA510/FormWaypoint/blob/HEAD/apps/web/src/App.jsx#L118-L150). | Storing JWTs in localStorage exposes them to XSS; there is no refresh token mechanism or automatic logout after expiry; authentication errors just redirect to login without explanation; there is no global loading indicator while checking auth state. | Store tokens in HTTP‑only cookies instead of localStorage; implement token refresh and auto‑logout on expiration; display a clear message when authentication fails (e.g., “Session expired, please sign in again”); show a loading spinner while auth status is being resolved. |

## General Observations

* **Consistency:** The UI leverages a consistent palette, typography and spacing. Icons from Lucide and Tailwind classes offer a modern look and feel. However, some pages (e.g., Kanban and ERP dashboard) rely on hard‑coded API paths pointing to localhost which will break outside of a development environment.

* **Accessibility:** Forms provide labels and placeholders, but radio cards and interactive panels sometimes lack ARIA attributes. Colour is often the sole indicator of status (e.g., map markers or report trends), which is problematic for colour‑blind users. Focus trapping in modals and keyboard navigation could be improved.

* **Error Handling:** Many fetch calls catch errors and log to the console but do not show user‑friendly messages. Where error states are implemented (e.g., import errors or compliance failures), the messaging is clear, but there is little guidance on next steps.

* **Performance:** Pages like Document Review and Reports load a lot of data and may cause performance issues on slower devices. Virtualisation or pagination could improve responsiveness. Debouncing search requests would reduce API load.

* **Security:** JWTs are stored in localStorage; sensitive information (e.g., credentials on the Integrations page) is persisted in plain text; API endpoints are not configured through environment variables. Use secure cookies and environment‑driven configuration for production.

## Conclusion

While FormWaypoint exhibits a polished design and a rich feature set, many usability challenges stem from incomplete implementations (mock APIs, hard‑coded endpoints) and complex, dense screens. Addressing API configuration, improving error handling and performance, and simplifying user flows will considerably enhance the user experience. Adopting responsive design patterns and accessibility best practices will further ensure that the application remains usable across devices and by users of varying abilities.
