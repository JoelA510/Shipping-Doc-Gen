# Infrastructure Scripts

Automation for provisioning Supabase resources, storage buckets, queues, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Initial Focus Areas
- Define Terraform/Pulumi project structure with environments (dev, staging, prod).
- Scripts for Supabase migration orchestration and schema validation in CI.
- GitHub Actions workflows for linting, testing, and deployment gates.
- Observability stack configuration (logs, metrics, traces) with alert thresholds.
