description: Test Plan -> write TEST_PLAN.md
---

Create/overwrite TEST_PLAN.md at repo root with:

- Goal
- Blast radius (files, modules, tables)
- Happy path test cases
- Sad path test cases (nulls, timeouts, retries, invalid inputs, double-submits, race conditions)
- Security checks (PII, injection, authz)
- Exact verification commands

Do not implement yet.
